After working on features and functionality of the `ssh-mitm <http://ssh-mitm.at/>`_
project it was decided that the features of the ssh-mitm version 0.4.0
should be locked and any further additions to its feature-set should be made externally.
This was done to keep the ssh-mitm project to its core functionality.
The ssh-mitm plugins are advanced features that should enhance the capabilities of the
ssh-mitm server.
Here you will find detailed feature-oriented documentation of the creators additions to the ssh-mitm project.
